# ShortcutUtilityBashScripts

just a shortcut of useful common commands of linux, all in these bash scripts to get it easier and faster instead of type multiple commands manually :)

to run all of these scripts, first you need to run the commands below me, to set the permission to run these scripts without using 'sh' each to run the script and just run it by stype the name file to run it :)

sh set-scripts-permission.sh
